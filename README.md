Companion repo for plots associated with "Challenging the Ô¨Åxed-criterion model of perceptual decision-making" (2023)

plot_didactic.m -- a simplified didactic plot showing what happens when mean and/ or variance of the SDT distributions shift-- the green line represents the Bayes optimal criterion.

plot_SDT_3panel.m -- you can play around with the mean and variance of the SDT distributions (corresponding to changes in attention or stimulus strength) to see what happens with a fixed vs. flexible criterion shift 

plot_embedded_cat.m -- you can play around with mean and variance of the SDT distributions corresponding to changes in the embedded category task, and see what happens with a fixed vs. flexible criterion shift
